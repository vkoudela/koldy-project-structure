# THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED

This project was in use long time ago while [Koldy Framework](https://github.com/vkoudela/koldy-php-framework) v1 was current version. Do not use
this for any of your projects. Instead, use new version of this project called [Koldy Boilerplate](https://github.com/koldy/boilerplate).
You can find more info on [koldy.net](https://koldy.net).

## Koldy New Site Template

This project contains initial minimal configuration files and directory structure that can be used with Koldy PHP framework. If you're starting a new project, then I'm recommending that you start with downloading this project.

### Configuration

- Point your virtual host to **public** folder
- Configure all application/configs/*.php files
- Be careful with configs - you may want to ignore those files in your .gitignore

To find more informations about project structure, go to [Koldy Docs](http://koldy.net/docs/project-structure)
