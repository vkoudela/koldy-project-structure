## Koldy New Site Template

This project contains initial minimal configuration files and directory structure that can be used with Koldy PHP framework. If you're starting a new project, then I'm recommending that you start with downloading this project.

### Configuration

- Point your virtual host to **public** folder
- Configure all application/configs/*.php files
- Be careful with configs - you may want to ignore those files in your .gitignore
