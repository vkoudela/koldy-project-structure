# The module's model files

Define only models in this folder that are working with database.

Feel free to create subfolders, but also make sure that subfolder names start with capital letter.

Example: if you create subfolder `User` and you create file `Account.php` in that folder, then in the `Account.php` define the namespace `User` and class should be named `Account`. That way, autoloader will know where to look for your classes.
